    <h1>Cuttle Fish</h1>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They
      belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid, octopuses, and
      nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
      is used for control of buoyancy. Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils,
      eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
      which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25
      cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, Sepia apama, reaching 50 cm (20
      in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass

    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <p>
      The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and
      temperate ocean waters. They are mostly shallow-water animals, although
      they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have an
      unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East
      and South Asia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean, as well as all
      coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas.
      By the time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North
      Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep for these warm-water
      species to cross.[11] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found
      in the Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may
      occur as far south as South Africa. They are found in sublittoral depths,
      between the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about
      180 m (600 ft).[12] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category
      of "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This means
      that while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in
      some regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic
      range prevents them from being too threatened. Ocean acidification,
      however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into
      the atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat

    <h3>Circulatory system</h3>
    <p>
      The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it
      uses the copper-containing protein haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of
      the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood.
      The blood is pumped by three separate hearts: two branchial hearts pump
      blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills (one heart for each), and the
      third pumps blood around the rest of the body. Cuttlefish blood must flow
      more rapidly than that of most other animals because haemocyanin carries
      substantially less oxygen than haemoglobin. Unlike most other mollusks,
      cephalopods like cuttlefish have a closed circulatory system
